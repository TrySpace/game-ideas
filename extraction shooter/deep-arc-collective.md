# Deep ARC Collective
Inspired by Deep Rock Galactive and ARC Raiders; Your life consists of working for an exploitative corporation like DRG, but in a post-apocalypse, and everyone kindof likes it. The world is a combination of drab and gritty post-apocalypse, but with elements of cyberpunk.
The world has been mostly taken over by insect-machine hybrids, but not all surfaces. Certain countries and islands have resilient strongholds of human resistance. They are a biological insectoid pest, which has silicon-based DNA spliced in.
Both have a presence in orbit as well as underground. Many procedural missions are played underground like DRG to exterminate machine-strongholds, but also above ground, where desolate landscapes are generated.
A core of designed open world levels are cycled with different main missions. Some of those levels are very large and operate more like PlanetSide 2, where different parts are constantly shifting between human and machine controlled, but only the human parts are playable. (There is possibility for human curation and control by a developers team that maintains sporadic interaction and novel events.)
Nearly all human technology is human-operated to avoid hackability by the machines.

## Core gameplay
Solo or 4 Player squad based. 4 Main different classes similar to DRG. But all players have basic mobility methods like a grappling hook, which will get more distance when you progress.

### Overworld
The overworld will start in the initial city you start in where you can buy, craft and advance at different locations. From there you can seemlessly travel outside to confront different challenges on the outskirts of the city.
Different cities/strongholds will become available as you progress.
Going to a mission with a squad will be as simple as going into an APC, choosing your mission and traveling there either automatically (via fasttravel-highways) or manually. Going manually can bring its own unique challenges, but also its own unique rewards.
From the open overworld you can enter several specific procedurally generated missions in different surrounding areas, each with their own properties much like the DRG biomes and their mission selection. More difficult biomes will become available in later cities.

## Enemies
Land based enemies are primarily 4 or more legged, since this gives the machines a greater redundancy. They have drones, dropships and tanklike forces. They don't use wheels because they are too vulnerable

## Human materiel
More on the classic side of wheeled vehicles like APCs and ATVs. But also tanks and aerial vehicles. All verhicles are operated manually.


## Levels
Giant open world levels designed for PvPvE, and procedurally generated levels for PvE missions.

### Underground
Basically like DRG, procedural underground areas that have traces of previous expeditions and require drilling, traversal of hazardous terrain, and vertical/horizontal challenges to bridge.
These will have frantic extraction sequences like DRG, where you have to get back to your original entry point, or reach another point within a certain time while fighting enemies or traversing difficult terrain.

### Vehicles
Depending on the type of level different vehicles will be available.
Underground missions will have drillers predeployed.
Open worlds will have basic transports and aerial vehicles for bigger battles.


## Tutorial
Starting a character, you'll start out as a young kid, who goes through the basic training for the first time, then skips to years later and you do some advanced training course. This serves mainly as world-building and storytelling and can be optionally skipped.
This sequence creates a similar but shorter more streamlined experience as fallout 4.
