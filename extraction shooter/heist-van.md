# Heist Van in Space
In a van with your squad, you navigate between starsystems to mine asteroids, and plan heists on different space stations or buildings on a planet.
Inspired by what Payday should have been but definitely isn't; the focus is on planning a heist and stealth. Breaching methods and distraction and disabling security systems and personel. You can brute force too, but expect formidable resistance depending on the value of the bounty.
Difficulty sways between hard and easy, but focuses more on having fun in the process and planning and improvising the stealth route and methods.
Levels are procedurally generated but seeds are consistent and shareable across the world. They are open worlds with different entry points and routes to the bounty point.
The gameplay beats are:
- Arrival and scoping out the place.
- Planning gear
- Choose entry point
- Maintain stealth or escalate to contain escalation
- Next entry point & planning
